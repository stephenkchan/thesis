\AtlasAbstract{ %
This note describes variations on the two lepton channel of the Run-2 search for the SM Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson using different variable sets for MVA training.  
The three variable sets in question are the set of variables from the fiducial analysis (utilizing the results of the kinematic fitter for the invariant masses of the $b$-jet pair and the lepton pair), a set based on the Lorentz Invariants (LI) concept, and a set based on a combination of masses and decay angles derived using the RestFrames (RF) package.
%The motivation for both the LI and RF variable schemes is a more complete description of a collision event in a more orthogonal basis of variablwes to both increase sensitivity and to reduce the overall impact of systematic uncertainties on fit quantities.
Aside from the variable sets used for MVA training and discirminant distributions, the analysis is otherwise identical to the fiducial anlaysis. %, employing the same simulation samples and collision data, object and event selection, signal and background modeling, sysematic uncertainties, and statistical treatment to extract the signal strength and other quantities of interest.
Both the LI and RF variable sets provide improvements with respect to the standard variable set, with the LI set showing an 11\% (17\%) improvement in expected (observed) significance on Run-2 data, and the RF set showing a 19\% (8\%) improvement in expected (observed) significance.
The error on the observed $\hat{\mu}$ signal strength from systematic uncertainties is similarly reduced in the LI and RF schemes, with the LI and RF sets showing a 11\% and 21\% reduction in systematic uncertainty on $\hat{\mu}$, respectively.
