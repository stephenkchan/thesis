Expected and observed sensitivities for the different variable sets may be found in Table \ref{tab:Sensitivities}.  The RF fits feature the highest expected sensitivities, outperforming the standard set by 3.5\% and 3.4\% for fits to Asimov and observed datasets, respectively.  The LI variable has a lower set than both for expected fits to both Asimov and data with a 6.7\% (1.7\%) significane than the standard set for the Asimov (observed) dataset.  While the fit using standard variables does have a higher observed significance than both the LI and RF fits, by 2.8\% and 8.6\%, respectively, these numbers should be viewed in the context of the best fit $\hat{\mu}$ values, discussed below.  That is, the standard set may yield the highest sensitivity for this particular dataset, but this is not necessarily the case for any dataset.

A summary of fitted signal strengths end errors for both the Asimov and observed datasets are shown in Figure \ref{fig:MuhatSummary}.  For reference, the standalone two lepton fit from the fiducial analysis is given .
