%A search for the decay of a Standard Model Higgs boson into $b\bar{b}$ pair when produced in association with a $W$ and $Z$ boson has been performed with Run1 and Run2 full data. In Run2 dataset, the measured signal strength with respect to the SM expectation is found to be $1.20^{+0.24}_{-0.23}(\textrm{stat.})^{+0.34}_{-0.28}(\textrm{syst.})$ at $m_{H}=125$ GeV. The observed (expected) significance is 3.5(3.0) standard deviations. The analysis has been validated by measuring the signal strength of $V(W/Z)Z(\rightarrow b\bar{b})$. The measured signal strength is $1.11^{+0.12}_{-0.11}(\textrm{stat.})^{+0.22}_{-0.19}(\textrm{syst.})$, corresponding to observed(expected) significance of 5.8(5.3) standard deviations.  

%This result based on Run2 data has been also combined with previous results on the Run1 dataset. The observed(expected) significance combined Run1 and Run2 is 3.6(4.0) standard deviation. The measured signal strength is $0.90^{+0.18}_{-0.18}(\textrm{stat.})^{+0.21}_{-0.19}(\textrm{syst.})$.
